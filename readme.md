# Challenge-two aka The Porfolio

## Descripitoin
This project I was tasked to create a website to house all my projects. Ths website will eventually used to show to future employers. However, the siter is only half done at the moment. I met most of the requirments for grading. But I would like to add alot more feature and make the website feel more like mine.
