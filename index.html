                    <p>Hi! My name is Anthony Harris and this is HWW (Harris in the Web & on the World). Below are the projects I have worked on to develop my skills as a web developer. Each section will be devoted to showcasing one of my projects. A small introductory paragraph will accompany each section describing what that project displays. Furthermore, links will be provided to the repository (via GitHub) as well as a live link. Resources that helped me in each project may also be available. Please feel free to explore the website, as I have a number of small features you may enjoy. And while you are here, leave me a message that you stopped by! Take care and be well all! Anthony Harris

                        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
