                    <p>Hi! My name is Anthony Harris and this is HWW (Harris in the Web & on the World). Below are the projects I have worked on to develop my skills as a web developer. Each section will be devoted to showcasing one of my projects. A small introductory paragraph will accompany each section describing what that project displays. Furthermore, links will be provided to the repository (via GitHub) as well as a live link. Resources that helped me in each project may also be available. Please feel free to explore the website, as I have a number of small features you may enjoy. And while you are here, leave me a message that you stopped by! Take care and be well all!
