                    <p>Hi! My name is Anthony Harris and this is HWW (Harris in the Web & on the World). Below are the projects I have worked on to develop my skills as a web developer. Each section will be devoted to showcasing one of my projects. A small introductory paragraph will accompany each section describing what that project displays. Furthermore, links will be provided to the repository (via GitHub) as well as a live link. Resources that helped me in each project may also be available. Please feel free to explore the website, as I have a number of small features you may enjoy. And while you are here, leave me a message that you stopped by! Take care and be well all!

                        <p>This project, my rite of passage “Hello World,” is a study guide I created while being introduced to the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. While this project is rough around the edges, it displays a very basic understanding and learning of web design. Fundamental concepts such as containers are deployed here to contain our sections. Very simple styling is used on our containers through the use of our property “box-shadow.” While no Javascript is displayed on our page, a quick look in the console via our Chrome Dev Tools will show a few “console.logs.” A brief view of the javascript file will further show a for loop, conditional logic, and the use of a function. Nothing is rather impressive here. However, this project was the perfect start to our journey in the web!</p>

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
